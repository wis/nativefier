A clear and concise description of what the bug is.


**Steps to reproduce**

Give your ***full*** nativefier command and its logs, with the ***`--verbose` flag***, on a ***public*** site:

```
nativefier --verbose --some-option https://mysite.com
<paste your verbose build logs too>
```


**Expected behavior**

What you expected to happen.


**Actual behavior**

**Debug info**

- Console logs of your `nativefier` build command, with `--verbose` flag
- If the bug happens at app run time, the in-app DevTools console logs (open it with F12)
- Error messages
- Screenshots
- Anything else relevant!


**Context**
